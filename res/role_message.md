Reaction Roles are a well known system.  
They allow people to get roles of their choosing without asking admins to give them.
Furthermore they allow for a small degree of automation regarding filtering and channel specific behaviour.

Here we have reaction roles used for modding support.
Follow the steps below to get your roles:
1. Are you a fabric modder? You should react with <:fabric:1001817020347723866> to this message.
